        Rubbing the sleep from his eyes, Sophal stands up from his foam mat and stretches long and tall. It was a typical night sleep - fitful due to the heat, dogs barking and street noises. He makes his way to that familiar spot on the floor where his
        grandmother hands him a bowl of noodle soup with a small piece of pork in it. He quickly slurps down the broth, pulls on a dingy white uniform shirt, slips on his flip flops, and begins the dusty walk to school.

      <div class="pulse" style="width:800px; font-family: 'Rokkitt'; font-size: x-large; position: relative; left: 40px;">
        The streets are an obstacle course of trucks, motorcycles, bicycles, cows, dogs, and kids. Boy, he wishes he could buy some of the grilled pork and rice from his favorite food cart.

        Sophal likes to get to school early. There is no playground on the campus of dirt and trash. He and his buddies play gambling games. Today is the sandle game but no money is involved. They need their money for the teacher.

      <div class="pulse" style="width:800px; font-family: 'Rokkitt'; font-size: x-large; position: relative; left: 40px;">
        School is only 4 hours a day 6 days a week. There are so many kids and so few teachers that the school day is split into morning and afternoon cohorts. Sophal wonders if he should just quit and find work to help his family. After all he is 11 years
        old and still in second grade. Plus he hates his teacher who slaps him.
